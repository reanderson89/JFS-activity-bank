// write a function that accepts an array of integers (whole numbers) and separates them into 2 different arrays. One array for even numbers and the other for odd numbers. This function should return both arrays.

// step 1. create a function, that accepts one parameter

// step 2. create 2 empty arrays inside of an object, called: evenNums and oddNums

// step 3. write a loop that will iterate through the incoming array

// step 4. write a condition that tests each number in the array to see if it is odd or even

// step 5. push the numbers to their correct array

// step 6. return the arrays inside of an object
