### Instructions

* Using the unsolved code as a starting point, create a complete application that meets the following specifications:

  * Users can enter keyboard input (action).

  * Each of the xwing's methods are assigned to a key.

  * When the user presses a key, it calls the appropriate function.

  * These actions also trigger a global function called `reWriteStats()` that logs the xwing's make, model, color, secondaryColor, massInTons, maxAcceleration, and `isWorking` status to the console.

* **HINT:** A "while loop" is already set up for you that will continue to ask the user for input as long as they don't press Cancel. Your logic will go inside this loop.

* **BONUS:** If the xwing flies around the galaxy, prevent the user from being able to fly the xwing until you give it a tune-up. Hint: isWorking property can be useful here.
