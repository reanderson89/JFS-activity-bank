# let-const

Make sure that you have linked your script.js to your index.html

In your script.js file, create 3 different variables using "let" and "const". Try out different data types. Numbers, booleans, strings, etc...

Try re-assigning a "let" variable and a "const" variable.

Then, print those variables to the console using console.log()
