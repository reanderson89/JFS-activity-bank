# Build a Weather App

For this activity you will be using a weather API from: https://www.weatherapi.com/ 

You will need to create a free account in order to get your own api-key. You can find the documentation on their website on how to write your url to get the information you need: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/

# We are not worried about how this application looks, just how it functions. 
    - The basic html has been created for you, please feel free to make it look better once you have full functionality.
    - You will need to display the "conditions".
    - Also display the image associated with the conditions.
    - The current temperature in fahrenheit should be shown.
    - Make sure to also display the name of the city that was searched.

## skills you will have to use
    - DOM manipulation
    - API calls
    - Reading documentation and looking up what you don't know
    - object and array notation
    - functions
    - built in methods of javascript objects


### Bonus

Use local storage to save all of the cities searched for and be able to add a clickable button for each city that will show the current weather when clicked. The page should also show the last city searched for when refreshed.
