# create a counter

In this activity, we are going to create a button that increments a counter when clicked.

* In your `index.html`, create a button containing the string "Up".

* In your `script.js`, make an onclick event listener that increases the number in the html by 1 every time it is clicked.

* Add another button that decreases the counter by 1 when clicked.

## Extra

* Write code that makes sure the counter doesn't go below 0.
