# Trivia activity

For this activity you are tasked to create a trivia game with at least 3 questions. You will need to use the `alert()` and `prompt()` features that are built into the browser in order to interact with the user. 

You can read up on them here: 
 - alert() - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp
 - prompt() - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp

This activity can be accomplished with functions and "for" loops. You are more then welcome to use other loops or iterators if you would like. 

Start with what you know, hard code first, then refactor.
