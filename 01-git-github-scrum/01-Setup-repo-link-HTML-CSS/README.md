## For this activity your goal is to...
1. Create new github repo
2. Clone the repo to your computer
2B. You do not need to make a new branch, you can work on `main`
3. Create `index.html` and use the `!` shortcut to create starter code
4. Add an `<h1>Hello World</h1>` to the `<body>`
5. Then create a `styles.css` file and change the `color` property of your `h1` to a color of your choice
6. Be sure to test your HTML in the browser and you should be able to see the color change of your Hello World text
7. If the color hasn't changed you may not have linked it correctly... `<link href="" rel="stylesheet">`
8. If it still doesn't work make sure that the spelling of your link and the files it is referring to are accurate and that your `<h1>` is in the `<body>` and has an opening and closing tag.
9. Once you have successfully linked your HTML and CSS, add your changes, commit them, and then push them to your remote.
10. Publish your site, Settings > Pages > select `main` from dropdown > Save
