# ABC-scrum-github-activity

- In this activity your group is tasked to create the ABC's by taking pictures of various items around you and add them to the index.html file to display them all. 

- These photos should be uploaded to the "photos" folder and then linked using the "src" attribute in the "img" tags in the index.html file. 

- Letter A has already been completed, use it as a reference for all other letters you have to complete. 

- You do not have to add any additional HTML code, you just need to add text inside of the existing "h1", "h3" tags and the "src" attributes inside of the "img" tags. 

## Begin this activity by... ##
- Having a scrum meeting!

- Your team should create a project board and then create an issue for EVERY letter. This is repetitive, and is meant to be used as practice. Start your first sprint by prioritizing the first easy items(letters) people have access to, once everyone is done with their letter, close the issues and then move to the next letters.

- Practice branching in your repository by creating a new branch for every letter that you work on. For example if you personally get tasked with letter C, then create a branch called "letterC". Once you finish that letter and are done with the branch, make sure to create a new branch for your next letter. For example, if you are next tasked with letter F your branch would be "letterF".

## Useful commands for creating and moving to branches...
    - `git branch` (shows current local branches)
    - `git branch branchName` (creates a new branch)
    - `git checkout branchName` (moves you to the branch listed)
    - `git checkout -b branchName` (creates a new branch and moves you to it)

## How to push a branch... 
    - `git status`
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m 'message'`
    - `git status`
    - `git pull origin main`
    - `git push origin branchName`

## Walk-through and links for getting everything set up ##
- Start by having one person "fork" this repository [Repo to Fork](https://github.com/reanderson89/ABC-scrum-github-activity) ... It's the repo your currently looking at.

- Remember that since you are "forking" this repository you do NOT need to create a new repository. Forking will do that for you, and grab all necessary starter code. Start by cloning the repo to your local machine after forking and adding collaborators. Don't forget to set the security on your main branch though!
