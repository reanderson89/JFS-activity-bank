## For this activity your goal is to...
1. Create new github repo, make it public and add a README.md (do this on github, DO NOT use the "git init" command)
2. Clone the repo to your computer (`git clone repo_url`)
3. You do not need to make a new branch, you can work on `main`
4. Create `index.html` and use the `!` shortcut to create starter code
5. Add an `<h1>Hello World</h1>` in the `<body>`
6. Be sure to test your HTML in the browser and you should be able to see your Hello World text.
7. Once you have successfully viewed your page.
    - `git status` to check your working directory
    - `git add .` or `git add file_name` to stage your changes
    - `git commit -m "some message about what you did"` to commit those changes creating a version of your code.
    - `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository
8. After you push your changes, go to the repository on github and confirm that you have a new `index.html` file.
