# Create-A-Fan-Page

For this activity you are tasked to build a fan page for your favorite music artist. You can only use HTML, no CSS or JavaScript.
Start by creating a new html document in your "sandbox" folder called fan-page.html


## Step 1 Requirements: (Build the structure and add content)
  - Your page must have navigation links to your artists web page.
  - It must have 2 different lists one ordered and one unordered.
  - It must contain at least 3 images that are relevant to your artist.
  - There needs to be either a video embedded or a link created to a video.
  - Include a brief biography. 
  - Include how you discovered them and why you like them.
  - Your page should read like a story, a beginning, middle, and end. (header, main, footer).

## Step 2 Requirements: (Build a table)
  - Build a table to show upcoming concerts (if there are none, then make up some dates and locations).
  - Each concert should have the following information: Date, Time, Location, Link to buy tickets. (4 columns).
  - The table should have a header and a body ( you can create an optional footer if you would like)
  - Display at least 3 concerts 

## Step 3 Requirements: (Build a form)
  - Your form should ask the user at least 4 different questions. For example: What is your favorite song? How many concerts have you been to? How many albums do you own from them? They can be whatever you would like.
  - You need to use a different "type" of input for each question.
  - You must use a "select" list and a "datalist".
  - Make sure that your form has a button to submit the users responses.

## BONUS
  - Redirect the user to a separate html page that you have created confirming their submission. You can add more content here if you would like as well.
